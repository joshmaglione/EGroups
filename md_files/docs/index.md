# EGroups

Author: [Joshua Maglione](https://joshmaglione.com/).

Documentation for the [Egroups](https://github.com/joshmaglione/egroups) package for [Magma](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/).

## Purpose

The goal of **EGroups** is to provide Magma with the algorithms developed in [Maglione&ndash;Stanojkovski](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03941). This includes constructors to build *E*-groups and functions to decide isomorphism of *E*-groups and compute (a generating set for) their automorphism groups. Mathematical details are provided in [Maglione&ndash;Stanojkovski](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03941). We outline the functions included in EGroups and provide example cases. 

## Importing

In order to use the functions in the EGroups package, one needs to attach the spec file. 

```C
> AttachSpec("path/to/EGroups/EGroups.spec"); 
```

## Funding 

This work was supported in part by DFG-grant [373111162](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/373111162?language=en) and DFG-GRK 2297 "Mathematical complexity reduction".
